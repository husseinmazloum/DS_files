-- Quiz

-- You've been tasked with returning data that shows; for each transaction date, the number of unique customers that transacted in-store.

-- To make it easy for stakeholders to view, ensure the output is ordered by transaction date (earliest to latest)

-- Your query will return two columns:

-- transaction_date (ordered)
-- customer_count (hint: you will create this)

select
  transaction_date,
  count(distinct customer_id) as customer_count
  
from
  grocery_db.transactions
  
group by
  transaction_date
  
order by
  transaction_date;
